### Introduction

This a repository for experimenting and trying Latex, also as storing and reusing examples for other projects.
You will most likely see three types of file:

- `.cls` - The class files which define the template
- `.sty` - The style files which define the fonts, and colors
- `.tex` - The tex files which contains the information mapped in the template

### References 

Class (`.cls`) and Styles (`.sty`) references Latex. I've tried to find the link to all author, if I made a mistake please let me know</br>

Here are some good tutorials on [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Creating_a_document_in_LaTeX) to start working with Latex.

### Fonts 

Fonts that are used. I've modified the name of the Roboto font so it was easier to change between fonts in the cv templates

- [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto)
- [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)

### Sources

Latex source files of the project (.tex, .cls, .sty) in the *src* folder.
